# Macroeconomic Analysis of Germany (2017–2025)

## Objective
- Conduct a top-down macroeconomic analysis of Germany to uncover structural trends, sectoral dynamics, and demographic shifts shaping investment and policy decisions.

## Approach
- Analyzed macroeconomic indicators from 2017 to 2025:
  - GDP grew from €3.27 trillion to a projected €4.18 trillion
  - Inflation peaked at 7.9% in 2022
  - Unemployment fell from 5.7% to 3.0%
  - Trade surplus contracted from €250B to €65B

- Modeled immigration impact:
  - 5M net arrivals (2017–2025), including 1.3M in 2023
  - Scenario analysis showed GDP boost of +0.8% to +1.3% by 2026

- Benchmarked Germany vs. EU peers

- Studied demographic shifts:
  - Median age rose from 44.4 to 46.1 years
  - Fertility rate held at 1.5 births/woman
  - 60% of immigrants were working-age, offsetting labor shortages

## Outcome
- Built a detailed time-series macroeconomic profile to support investment and policy decisions
- Confirmed Germany's export dominance: export-to-GDP ratio stable at 47.5% by 2024
- Flagged structural risks: labor shortages, aging population, and rising dependency ratios
