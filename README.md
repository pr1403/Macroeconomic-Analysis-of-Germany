# Macroeconomic-Analysis-of-Germany
**Objective**

Conduct a top-down macroeconomic analysis of Germany to uncover structural trends, sectoral dynamics, and demographic shifts shaping investment and policy decisions.

**Approach**

Analyzed key macroeconomic indicators from 2017 to 2025:
• GDP growth from €3.27 trillion to projected €4.18 trillion
• Inflation peaked at 7.9% in 2022
• Unemployment declined from 5.7% to 3.0%
• Trade surplus reduced from €250 billion to €65 billion

Modeled immigration trends with over 5 million net arrivals (2017–2025), including 1.3 million in 2023

Developed best, base, and worst-case scenarios to estimate GDP impacts of immigration (+0.8% to +1.3% by 2026)

Conducted regional benchmarking comparing Germany's performance with other EU nations

Studied demographic shifts: rising median age (44.4 to 46.1), low fertility rates (1.5 births/woman), and increasing reliance on working-age immigrants (60% of arrivals)

**Outcome**

Compiled a detailed time-series macroeconomic profile of Germany to inform investment strategies and policy frameworks

Demonstrated Germany’s continued export leadership, with export intensity sustained at 47.5% of GDP by 2024

Identified critical structural challenges, including labor shortages and rising old-age dependency ratios
